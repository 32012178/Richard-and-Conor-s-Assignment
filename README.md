Q. Did Covid vaccines affect covid case numbers and deaths in 4 different countries?



Conor's Analysis 

types of graphs used Bar, and line.

I used 2 types of Bar graphs, the first shows the dirstibution of for isntance covid cases as a proportion of the population, and the second was a bar graph that out of  the 4 locations and the total cases, people_vaccinated and population. Neither of these worked really well, since our specific data had large amounts of values dispersions. for instance Australia had a population of 25 million compared to India's 1.4 billion is not compareableon a small figsize. And i idiotically discovered this too late. next time i'd spend less time sciefing through data and just get on with it. i wasted way too much time looking at different data. 

my line graphs worked really well. I was really happy with them and they demonstrated the correlations i wanted. 

I enjoyed working with Richard and this topic, hwoever richard and I bot hagreed that we would like to work on another topic next time.
